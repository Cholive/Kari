                <p> My career started as a Web Developer when I was a first year Software Developer student. During that time I took courses which peaked my interest 
                    and I decided to change my major to Web Developer. What I really enjoyed about website design was the fact that I could see 
                    the results in real time and learning the aspects of interface design and how to do layouts to be user friendly. I really enjoyed doing UI/UX frameworks
                    and front-end development. I have learned such fascinating material on the front-end such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Sass to back-end such as Node.js, Express and MongoDB, just to name a few. I am super excited to start
                    this new career and believe I am on the right path in something I will enjoy doing for years to come.</p>
